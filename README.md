## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The aim of this project is to create a simplified and minimal solution of the [Premier League Fantasy Football (game)](#https://fantasy.premierleague.com/). This document provides details of design and implementation of the project. Additonally, the data used within the project can be found [here](#https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League).

## 2. Requirements Analysis <a name="requirements"></a>

* 2 Goalkeepers (**GK**)
* 5 Defenders (**DEF**)
* 5 Midfielders (**MID**)
* 3 Forwards (**FWD**)

A squad can contain a **maximum** of **3 players** from a **single Premier League team**.

The starting **11 players** along with **4 substitutes** must be selected by the user. 

### 2.2 Requirements <a name="requirements2"></a>
* User Accounts
  * The web application should allow a user to create an account
  * The web application should allow a user to log in 
  * The web application should allow a user to sign out of their account
  * The web application should allow a user to delete their account
* Squads
  * The web application should allow a user to create their squad
  * The web application should allow a user to save their squad

## 3. Architecture & Design <a name="architecture"></a>
### 3.1. Database Structure <a name="db"></a>
The project uses a single relational database containing 5 tables: users, squads, squadplayers, players, teams. The **entity relationship diagram** for the database is shown below:

## 4. Planning <a name="planning"></a>
 The type of Kanban board used within this project is **Azure Boards**. The requirements gathered in [Section 2](#requirements) were used to create the **issues** inside of **Azure Boards** to track the implementation of features within the project.

## 5. Risk Assessment <a name="requirements"></a>
